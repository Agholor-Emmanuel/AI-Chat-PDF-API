Chat-PDF-API:

An LLM powered Chat-PDF API service so you can chat with your PDF files.

Project Description:

This project involves the development of a RESTful API that enables interactive conversations with PDF documents using a Large Language Model (LLM). The API allows users to upload PDF files, processes the document's content, and uses advanced text embeddings to transform the text into a searchable vector database. With this setup, users can ask natural language questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs and receive accurate and contextually relevant answers.

The application is built with FastAPI and utilizes key Python libraries such as PyPDF for PDF text extraction, LangChain for text chunking, and a custom LLM model for generating responses. The API supports various file handling and data processing tasks, ensuring the uploaded documents are properly parsed and converted into meaningful data that can be queried interactively.
